Download the latest `wtf.linux` on https://github.com/blunt1337/wtfcmd/releases/latest.
Then move and rename that file into your $PATH, for example with `sudo mv /Users/$USER/Downloads/wtf.linux /usr/local/bin/wtf`.
And make it executable with `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wtf`.

Now test it by opening a new terminal, and type `wtf`.
To install the autocomplete, run `wtf --autocomplete install`.
You can rename `wtf` by another name, it will still work :3
